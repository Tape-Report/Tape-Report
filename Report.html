<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Project Background</h1>
<p>Each roll of tape was divided into 3 sections based on each roll’s length and each roll of tape was divided into 3 sections based on each roll’s length. Site 1 refers to the beginning section of each roll, site 2 refers to the middle section of each roll and site 3 refers to the last/end section of each roll. Meanwhile, the width and thickness were measured using a caliber tool.</p>
<p>The experiment descriptions and procedures involves multiple points. The width measurements of the tapes were meticulously conducted on a singular day, with three measurements taken at each designated site, resulting in a total of nine measurements per roll. In contrast, the thickness measurements spanned multiple days, with a key emphasis on blind measurements, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data. Similar to the width measurements, the thickness measurements also consisted of three measurements at each site, yielding a total of nine measurements per roll.</p>
<p>To assess the significance of the findings, the client utilized a two-factor ANOVA with replicated analysis, both for the widths and the thicknesses of the tapes. This robust statistical approach was employed to determine whether there existed any noteworthy differences among the various tape samples. Additionally, the client employed a power of discrimination formula, as referenced in pertinent research literature, to discern if significant variations were present among groups of tapes with distinct physical attributes. Furthermore, this formula was adeptly utilized to ascertain the presence of significant disparities among the tape groups with differing physical characteristics and angle of extinctions, contributing to the comprehensive evaluation of the experimental data.</p>

<p>As we grasp the ultimate goals and objectives of this project, the client seeks to determine whether various types of tape can be reliably distinguished from one another. The primary aim is to investigate the potential use of tape as trace evidence in forensic science. Key aspects related to the tapes include, firstly, their frequent presence on victims or their use by suspects in the creation of improvised explosive devices. Secondly, the question arises of whether tape can be considered as questioned evidence, subject to comparison with known samples to establish links between individuals and specific cases.</p>

<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Models</h1>
<p>The method used to analyze the dissimilarities between each of the 22 tapes involves visualizing a heatmap with hierarchical clusterings of the tapes. These clusterings are determined by the “distances” between each tape.</p>
<section id="sec-distances" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-distances"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Tape Distances</h2>
<p>Defining a distance between tapes provides a measure of dissimilarity between each tape. Variables for each of the tapes included three numerical variables (width, thickness of backing, and thickness of backing and adhesive) as well as 12 categorical variables. Not all of the variables are numeric and as a result, the Gower’s distance is calculated between two tapes which accounts for both numerical and categorical variables. Before taking the Gower’s distance between each tape, the categorical variables were first converted to numeric values by encoding each level of the variable 1 to the total number of levels of that variable. For example, the categorical variable <code>Texture</code> has three levels: “Rough”, “Smooth”, “Slightly Rough”. “Rough” was coded as 1, “Smooth” was coded as 2, and “Slightly Rough” was coded as 3. Each number was then divided by the total number of levels to obtain normalized variables from 0 to 1. In the example, “Rough” now has the numerical value 0.33, “Smooth” now has the numerical value 0.67, and “Slightly Rough” now has the numerical value 1.</p>
<p>Once all categorical variables were coded numerically, Gower’s distance calculates a matrix of dissimilarities for each of the <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \frac{22(22-1)}{2} = 231\)</span> pairs of tapes. For the three numerical variables, a range-normalized Manhattan distance is calculated: <span class="math display">\[|\frac{T_{ik} - T_{jk}}{\text{range}_k}|\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(i, j = 1, 2, \dots, 22\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k = 1, 2, 3\)</span>. For the remaining 12 categorical variables, the distance is calculated with the following formula: <span class="math display">\[I(T_{im} \neq T_{jm})\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(i, j = 1, 2, \dots, 22\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m = 4, 5, \dots, 15\)</span>. This indicator will equal 1 if <span class="math inline">\(T_{im} \neq T_{jm}\)</span> and 0 if <span class="math inline">\(T_{im} \neq T_{jm}\)</span>. Gower’s distance between two tapes is calculated by summing these variable distances and dividing by 15, the number of variables.</p>

<section id="heatmap" class="level2" data-number="4.2">
<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="heatmap"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Heatmap</h2>
<p>Once we have the pairwise distances between tapes from the data, we can use a heatmap and multidimensional scaling to visually identify similarities and dissimilarities between tapes. In a heatmap cells are color-coded to quickly compare one row or tape to another. The heatmap also allows one to aggregate the rows in clusters based on the distances calculated from the previous section. The following figure is the heatmap generated for the 22 tapes using Gower’s distance.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multidimensional-scaling"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Multidimensional Scaling</h2>
<p>Multidimensional scaling provides another method of visualizing these clusters and their distances from each other on a two dimensional plot. Although the data for each tape is multivariate, multidimensional scaling preserves the distances between pairwise observations when plotting. Multidimensional scaling also takes in the distances calculated from <a href="#sec-distances">Section&nbsp;4.1</a> and returns a set of 22 points where the distances between each point is approximately equal to the dissimilarities between each point. These points are then plotted on a two dimensional scatter plot to visualize the “closeness” of the tapes and can be viewed below.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD pheatmap analysis: According to pheatmap pictures, 22 tapes were divided into 5 clusters. Cluster 1 is composed of Tape 10(Scotch Single Sided), Tape 19(Pen + Gear Double-Sided), Tape 2(3M 600 Scotch), Tape 3(Scotch Double-Sided), Tape 9(Scotch Scarpbooking) and Tape22(Up &amp; Up Double-Sided).</p>

<p>Therefore, according to the analysis of pheatmap, we can know that pheatmap can effectively distinguish different tapes and find out their similar rules.
